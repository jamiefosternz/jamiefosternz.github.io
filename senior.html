			<h1>Senior Science</h1>
			<p>Senior Science in Year 12 and 13 allows students to specialize in fields of science they choose. Unlike Junior Science, specific fields (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Earth and Space) have full period times allocated to them.  Having much more class time allows for a more in-depth understanding of science.  Level 2 is considered by most to be the biggest step up in high school.  Because of this it's essential that students utilise good time management.  As with Junior Science, sciPAD is a great resource for revision.</p>

			<h1>Biology</h1>
			<p>Biology is the study of living things.  Biology in year 12 and 13 consists of two internals and three externals.  The internals are; a written report and an investigation.  The main difference between Y12 and Y13 is the level of help you get from your teacher.  For example, the marking schedule for the Y12 investigation says that it should be done "with supervision", meaning that the teacher will set the guidelines for you.  This isn't so in year 13, where you are allowed to do whatever you want.  The externals in Y12 focus on life processes and genetics, which is all intertwined closely with chemistry.  In y13, emphasis on evolution and theoretical biology is more common, and as such will not be so chemistry based.</p><br />
			<a id="chemistry"></a>
			<h1>Chemistry</h1>
			<p>Chemistry is the study of how elements interact with each other to form substances.  Unlike junior science, there is a heavy emphasis on being able to accurately conduct practical experiments.  This is most notable in the quantitive chemistry internal, where you must conduct an acid-base reaction while measuring the reactants accurately (this is known as a titration).  In doing this you are able to calculate the unknown concentration of one reactant based off of the known concentration of the other.  The externals in Y12 require you to have an understanding of chemical bonds, organic compounds, and reactivity.</p>
			<a id="physics"></a>
			<h1>Physics</h1>
			<p>Physics is widely considered to be one of the hardest subjects you can take.  It requires you to have excellent knowledge of algebraic concepts to solve complex equations in fields of Electronics, Mechanics, Waves, and Atomic Physics.  In addition to good algebraic knowledge, you must have an excellent understanding of the aspects of atoms, waves, and forces.  All the assessments are quite strict, and are held in exam conditions.  In addition to this the exams are structured so that not much writing is required, which is appealing for many.</p>
			<a id="other"></a>
			<h1>Earth & Space Science</h1>
			<p>Earth & Space Science is a more general topic.  It covers a wide range of fields such as geology, environmental science, and astronomical science.  Earth & Space utilises knowledge from the three root fields of science, but doesn't get into specific details.  Consider this to be "applied" science.  Earth & Space has a lot of writing involved compared to the other sciences, as it's focussed on your ability to effectively analyse and research rather than learn rote information</p>
